// This is pretty tricky, we need to set the color to use within string
// interpolation for stuff that is not matched to a token.  'inherit' is wrong
// because that inherits from the 'quoted string' context -- we want the base
// 'text color' really.
// Go for a dark gray that won't look too amiss with the regular themes.
// Not that this is common enough for anyone to notice...
$j2-article-color: #222;

// Bodge in a jazzy style rule to knock out the background when in a
