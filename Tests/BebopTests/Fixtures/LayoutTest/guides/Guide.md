Here comes the heading:

# Heading

After the heading.

```
func shouldBeSwift() throws {
}
```

```objc
/// Should be objective C
@interface MyObject: NSObject
```

* callout(lovely): bones!

### DocC callouts

> important: Do not run

Here comes a tip:

> Tip: Always walk
>
> Another paragraph in the tip.

Warnings have a color.
> Warning: Be alert

Non-callout lines are required between callouts.

> experiment: Nested callouts...
> > experiment: ...work.
> >
> > They work in DocC too though this might not be intentional.

Finally:

> Malformed or untitled callouts appear as *Note*s in DocC but Bebop
> shows them as traditional block-quotes for compatibility with GFM
> and existing docs.
